Key Functionality :

• Implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
• Tab Navigation : Users can switch between different tabs (”Your Weather” and ”Search Weather”) to view
weather information for their current location or search for weather by city name.
• Geolocation Access : Users are prompted to grant access to their location. If granted, the app retrieves
weather information based on the user’s current location using the Geolocation API.
• Loading Screen : A loading screen is displayed while the weather data is being fetched from the API.
• Display Weather Information : Once weather data is fetched, it is displayed in the UI, including city name,
country flag, weather description, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
• API Integration : It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
• Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
• Session Storage: It utilizes session storage to store and retrieve user coordinates, reducing the need for repetitive location requests.
• Error Handling: The app handles errors gracefully, displaying alerts if there are issues with fetching weather data.
